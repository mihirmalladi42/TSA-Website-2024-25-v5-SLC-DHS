        <p>Hello, I am Mihir Malladi, and I am the lead director of ImPeckable! ImPeckable started off as a small idea that eventually grew to be a full-on website. From a simple side project at school, I eventually grew a team of 5 and founded this restaurant. The goal is to give anyone quality access to great vegetarian food. I am a vegetarian, so I wanted to make a restaurant that incorporates every cuisine! I hope you enjoy our gift of ImPeckable!</p>
